# PyTorch CNN Image Classification

The repository includes all the files related to the implemented CNN architecture, training/testing, feature embedding as well as the similarity search modules. The folder *resources* also consists of the trained model and the extracted features.  

The *project_pipeline.py* module holds the entire workflow of the project, ranging from training the CNN model, which can be configured in *cnn_model.py*, to validation and extracting features. All the modules are implemented by python 3.8.
